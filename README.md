## A collection of *RegEx* and *Exact* filters for use with Pi-holeÂ® v5+ *FTLDNS*

The ***purpose*** of this repository is to compliment your existing **Pi-hole** filters using ***powerful*** regular expressions (**RegEx**) that cover a broad range of domains ***in one go***. Included are an optional customized list of **Exact** filters and the ability to add or remove entries from the **Adlist Group**.
__________
### A series of major tweaking was performed between 02.01.23 and 02.04.23

#### **Adlists changes**
  - The pihole_adlist_tool allowed the elimination of **almost 75% of the total domains blocked** due to the **extremely low hit count** over the last 2 months
  - The adlists that are no longer included produced a maximum of **1 hit each** and a max **unique domain coverage of 4** compared to the **hundreds of unique domains** that the other lists registered

#### **Exact & RegEx changes**

  - Duplicate entries that were already covered by the adlists were removed
  - Domains that shared likeness were put into the RegEx lists to free up the total length of the Exact lists (tested and working)
  - Filters that bypass video ads on yahoo.com and serverly cut back video ads on twitch.tv are now included

## The filter lists
  - **[Adlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slyfox1186/pihole-regex/main/domains/adlist/adlists.txt)**
