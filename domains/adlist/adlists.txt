#          SlyFox1186's Customized AdList
#
#  I analyzed the adlists over a period of 180 days using the
#  pihole_adlist_tool's analytics which told me how often each list
#  produces a "hit" of some nature. I keep the least amount of adlists
#  required to cover all the domains with "hits" registered. This allows
#  the adlists database to stay as slim as possible and this helps speedup
#  pihole's efficiency overall.
