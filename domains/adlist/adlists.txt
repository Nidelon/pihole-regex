##          SlyFox1186's Customized AdList
##
##  I analyzed the adlists over a period of 180 days using the
##  pihole_adlist_tool's analytics which told me how often each list
##  produces a "hit" of some nature. I keep the least amount of adlists
##  required to cover all the domains with "hits" registered. This allows
##  the adlists database to stay as slim as possible and this helps speedup
##  pihole's efficiency overall.
